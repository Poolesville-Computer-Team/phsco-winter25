# Did you know?
# Python is a pretty slow language.
# 
# One easy way to speed it up is by changing the submission language
# from "Python 3" to "PyPy 3" in Codeforce's dropdown!
# 
# PyPy uses the same syntax of Python, but with a more optimized compiler.
# In other words, since you don't have to change the code on your end,
# I'd take the free timesave since there's really no downside.
#
# If you still don't believe me, try submitting this solution as both
# a Python file and a PyPy file.
